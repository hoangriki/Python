Try this exercise to understand how tests work with inputs in Auditorium. Write some code that multiples together the two numbers in the input area. When you run the tests, different inputs will replace the ones in the input area and pass the new inputs through your code.
Important
Your code has to work for all the different input sets. e.g.
print(6)
This is not correct, because it only works for one set of inputs. You should only print one number into the output.

num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())

Solution:
num1 = input("What is the first number: ")
num2 = input("What is the second number: ")
print(num1 * num2)
